       "  'summary': 'Recent successes of artificial intelligence and deep learning often depend on\\nthe well-collected training dataset which is assumed to have an identical\\ndistribution with the test dataset. However, this assumption, which is called\\nclosed-set learning, is hard to meet in realistic scenarios for deploying deep\\nlearning models. As one of the solutions to mitigate this assumption, research\\non out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been actively explored in various\\ndomains. In OOD detection, we assume that we are given the data of a new class\\nthat was not seen in the training phase, i.e., outlier, at the evaluation\\nphase. The ultimate goal of OOD detection is to detect and classify such unseen\\noutlier data as a novel \"unknown\" class. Among various research branches for\\nOOD detection, generating a virtual outlier during the training phase has been\\nproposed. However, conventional generation-based methodologies utilize\\nin-distribution training dataset to imitate outlier instances, which limits the\\nquality of the synthesized virtual outlier instance itself. In this paper, we\\npropose a novel methodology for OOD detection named Auxiliary Range Expansion\\nfor Outlier Synthesis, or ARES. ARES models the region for generating\\nout-of-distribution instances by escaping from the given in-distribution\\nregion; instead of remaining near the boundary of in-distribution region.\\nVarious stages consists ARES to ultimately generate valuable OOD-like virtual\\ninstances.

       "  'summary': 'The evolutionary processes of complex systems contain critical information\\nregarding their functional characteristics. The generation time of edges\\nprovides insights into the historical evolution of various networked complex\\nsystems, such as protein-protein interaction networks, ecosystems, and social\\nnetworks. Recovering these evolutionary processes holds significant scientific\\nvalue, including aiding in the interpretation of the evolution of\\nprotein-protein interaction networks. However, existing methods are capable of\\npredicting the generation times of remaining edges given a partial temporal\\nnetwork but often perform poorly in cross-network prediction tasks. These\\nmethods frequently fail in edge generation time recovery tasks for static\\nnetworks that lack timestamps. In this work, we adopt a comparative\\nparadigm-based framework that fuses multiple networks for training, enabling\\ncross-network learning of the relationship between network structure and edge\\ngeneration times. Compared to separate training, this approach yields an\\naverage accuracy improvement of 16.98%. Furthermore, given the difficulty in\\ncollecting temporal networks, we propose a novel diffusion-model-based\\ngeneration method to produce a large number of temporal networks.

       "  'summary': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years,\\nyet it continues to struggle with a fundamental aspect of cognition present in\\nall animals: common sense. Current AI systems, including those designed for\\ncomplex tasks like autonomous driving, problem-solving challenges such as the\\nAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and conversational benchmarks like the\\nTuring Test, often lack the ability to adapt to new situations without\\nextensive prior knowledge. This manuscript argues that integrating common sense\\ninto AI systems is essential for achieving true autonomy and unlocking the full\\nsocietal and commercial value of AI.\\n  We propose a shift in the order of knowledge acquisition emphasizing the\\nimportance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and\\nare capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment -- even\\nwithin abstract domains. Additionally, we highlight the need to rethink the AI\\nsoftware stack to address this foundational challenge. Without common sense, AI\\nsystems may never reach true autonomy, instead exhibiting asymptotic\\nperformance that approaches theoretical ideals like AIXI but remains\\nunattainable in practice due to infinite resource and computation requirements.\\n  While scaling AI models and passing benchmarks like the Turing Test have\\nbrought significant advancements in applications that do not require autonomy,\\nthese approaches alone are insufficient to achieve autonomous AI with common\\nsense.
